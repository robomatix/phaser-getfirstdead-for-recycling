phaser-getfirstdead-for-recycling
=================================

An attempt to use the method of group in phaser : getFirstDead for recycling...

Official doc : http://docs.phaser.io/Phaser.Group.html#getFirstDead


APPARENTLY, THIS IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO RECYCLE ITEMS IN PHASER...
I'LL DO ANOTHER ATTEMPT WITH getFirstExist as we can see in the official example...
